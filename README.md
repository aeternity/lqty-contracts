### Demo oracle

Simple test using the oracle [ae-oracle-pricefeed](git://github.com/aeternity/ae-oracle-pricefeed) to get AE/USD price from [coingeko](https://www.coingecko.com/), also installs a service [price-service](./price-service/price-service.js) which periodically pools new prices from the oracle and injects it in loan app. 

Run it: `make demo-oracle`

There is also a variation [price-service-query.js](./price-service/price-service.js), where the pooling service does not inject directly the price from the oracle, instead when the query is ready it sends the `query id` to the loan app, and the loan app gets directly the price using the `query id`.


### Price feed pooling service

Service that periodically pools new prices [ae-oracle-pricefeed](git://github.com/aeternity/ae-oracle-pricefeed) oracle, depoying an instance of it, and injects it in loan app ([PriceFeedTestnet](./test/contracts/PriceFeedTestnet.aes)). 

The frequency of the price refreshing can be modified with the environment variable `AWAIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, the default frequency is 10 seconds.
